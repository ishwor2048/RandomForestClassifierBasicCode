# RandomForestClassifierBasicCode
This repo I have built up to figure out how simply RandomForestClassifier can with very good level of accuracy. I worked on building confusion matrix where there were only 2 data points which were wrongly predicted by the model.

RandomForestClassifier has been all time very strong classifier and regressor both. While learning this model with more clarification than what I know now
I have come up through some import point which contributes on everyone's learning stage, here are some of those:

Some of the strong contributing part of RandomForest Model:
1) Entropy: Entropy is the measure of randomness or unpredictability of the dataset
2) Information Gain: It is the measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split into trees.
3) Leaf Node: It carries the classification or the decision.
4) Decision Node: Decision Node has two or more branches of the decision.
5) Root Node: Root Node is the top most decision node which doesn't have any initial classification.
